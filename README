Sd-Docs: Square dance documentation

This directory holds the source files for various documentation I have
worked on.  These are typically LaTeX and converted to PDF using
"pdflatex" and various corresponding *.sty files that support drawing
diagrams of square dance formations.

The PDF files are generally publicly available on various web sites
such as:

https://callerlab.org
https://challengedance.org

Some files here may only be portions of the publicly available PDF files.
For example, the Callerlab documents are maintained in MS Word by
the Callerlab Home Office.  The portions available here use
the "standalone" package to create diagrams in PNG format that
are then manually imported into the official MS Word documents.
