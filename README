Sd-Docs: Square dance documentation

This directory holds the source files for various square dance definitions
and articles.  The source files are named *.tex and can be converted to PDF
using pdflatex and various corresponding *.sty files.

A complete description of producing PDF files from these files is
given at:
https://challengedance.org/latexmacros.html

There are two types of LaTeX files in this repository (all named *.tex):

(1) Full technical articles, such as my papers on Mimic.
    Updates require editing the *.tex file and rerunning pdflatex.

(2) Standalone pictures (dancer diagrams) written for Callerlab.
    These are then imported into MS Word documents.
    All Callerlab definitions are currently maintained in MS Word
    by the Callerlab Home Office.  
    Updates to the diagrams require rerunning pdflatex with suitable
    options to also produce a PNG file, and then manually importing
    the PNG file into the appropriate MS Word document.

The files designed to create standalone pictures all reference the
"standalone" package.
